# JLR-4x4-In-Schools-Challenge

This is the code we wrote for the Raspberry Pi to control our automatic lighting circuit and tilt warning circuit. 
What made our car unique was the status LCD screen which uses the adafruit IC2 library.
The Logic for the lighting circuit was based on the code written by Simon Monk.
Feel free to use the code in anyway you want at your own risk!
